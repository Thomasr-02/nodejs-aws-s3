Logging Requirements for Data Operations in Multiple Storage Systems

Introduction
This document proposes a logging framework for recording data operations (create, update, delete) performed across various storage systems, including databases, Amazon S3, and other storage platforms. The proposed framework aims to enhance visibility, traceability, and accountability by ensuring that all data operations are appropriately logged.

Logging Requirements
All data operations, including create, update, and delete actions, must be logged. The logging requirements include:

Timestamp: Each log entry should contain a timestamp indicating the date and time when the operation occurred. This helps in chronological ordering and enables easy tracking of events.

Operation Type: The log entry should specify the type of operation performed (create, update, or delete) to distinguish between different data actions.

Affected Entity: The log entry should identify the specific entity or object that was subject to the data operation. This could be a record ID, file name, or any other identifier that uniquely represents the affected entity.

Storage System: The log entry should include information about the storage system or platform where the data operation took place. This allows for easier identification of the location of the affected data.

User or Process: The log entry should capture the identity of the user or process responsible for initiating the data operation. This helps in accountability and tracing back the source of any data modifications.

Outcome: The log entry should indicate the outcome of the operation, such as success, failure, or any relevant error messages. This information assists in understanding the result of the operation and troubleshooting any issues.

Logging Implementation
The logging framework can be implemented using various mechanisms, such as:

Centralized Logging Service: Utilize a centralized logging service or tool that can receive and store log entries from different storage systems. This approach ensures a consolidated view of all data operations across multiple projects.

Integration with Storage Systems: Integrate logging functionality directly into the storage systems being used. This can be achieved through custom logging libraries, hooks, or triggers that capture and record data operations.

Standard Logging Formats: Adhere to a standardized logging format, such as JSON or structured log entries, to facilitate parsing and analysis of the logged data.

Data Privacy and Security Considerations
When implementing logging mechanisms, data privacy and security should be prioritized. Ensure that sensitive information, such as personally identifiable data or confidential business data, is not logged or is appropriately anonymized to comply with applicable regulations and protect user privacy.

Compliance and Audit Requirements
Logging data operations can assist with compliance and audit requirements. The logged information can be used for auditing purposes, investigating incidents, and demonstrating regulatory compliance, if applicable.

Integration with Monitoring and Alerting Systems
Consider integrating the logging framework with monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies, monitor performance, and proactively address any issues related to data operations.

Conclusion
By implementing a logging framework that captures create, update, and delete operations across multiple storage systems, organizations can improve visibility, traceability, and accountability of data modifications. This RFC proposes the necessary logging requirements and considerations to ensure that all operations on databases, S3, and other storage platforms are appropriately logged. Implementing this framework will enhance data governance and facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements.
